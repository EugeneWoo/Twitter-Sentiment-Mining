The goal of this project is to provide a simple example of mining tweets for sentiments using a bag of words approach.

The Sentiment Lexicon for this project is taken from Hu and Liu's opinion lexicon. See http://www.cs.uic.edu/~liub/FBS/sentiment-analysis.html for source information and http://www.cs.uic.edu/~liub/FBS/opinion-lexicon-English.rar to download their opinion lexicon.
